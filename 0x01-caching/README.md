# Caching System: 0x01

## Overview

This project implements various caching strategies using Python. It includes the following cache classes:


1. **BasicCache**: A base class that provides common functionality for caching.

2. **FIFOCache**: Inherits from `BasicCache` and implements First-In-First-Out (FIFO) caching.

3. **LIFOCache**: Inherits from `BasicCache` and implements Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) caching.

4. **LRUCache**: Inherits from `BasicCache` and implements Least Recently Used (LRU) caching.

5. **MRUCache**: Inherits from `BasicCache` and implements Most Recently Used (MRU) caching.

6. **LFUCache**: Inherits from `BasicCache` and implements Least Frequently Used (LFU) caching (advanced).
